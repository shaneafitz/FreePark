### UX/DX approach

The UX/DX approach was completed following the Placemark case-study labs. The application utilises
an MVP (Model View Presenter) architectural pattern

---
### Git approach adopted

Git approach was to have one master branch and then branch off into two separate develop branches,
one for implementing MVP approach and one for implementation to persist to am SGLite Database. There
are 3 release branches;
 1. for assignment 1
 2. for MVP update
 3. for final release

### Personal statement

All work completed is based on the labs provided. This was a challenging module and I found the Placemark
labs particularly difficult. I tried to apply the learnings from the labs into the assignment
